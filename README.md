Software Engineering course project modeling a dental clinic system. Our group modeled it first, and then coded a demo for the "book appointment" feature.

Deliverable 1: SRS and Use Case Documents

Deliverable 2: Architecture Document, including Component Diagrams and
Deployment Diagrams.

Deliverable 3: Sequence Diagrams, Detailed-Class Diagram, GUI
Samples,and Testing (White Box, Black Box, and
Automation methods employed). Additionally we used the class diagrams
to create a sample script for the "book appointment" feature.

Overall, this project was instrumental in teaching me about the process
of software engineering. The biggest challenge we encountered was the
vague nature of the requirements, which we resolved by scheduling
meetings with the professor (roleplaying as the customer) to gather
specification. This is important because in the real world, the customer
is not likely going to be able to "speak code" with the software
production team.
